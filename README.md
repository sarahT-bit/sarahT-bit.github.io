Generate a SPA where CS students can get help on a tutoring platform on various CS topics such as Data Structures, Intro To Theory Comp., 
Discrete Structures, etc. There's a page where the user also has the option to click on whatever programming language they need help on if they need it.
Once the student types in their problem, the page then loads up with a message, " Linking you to a tutor". Once a tutor is found, there's a video interaction
on the right corner with a chat box below. That way, the student and the tutor can talk. Keep the chat box texts up to date. Let there be a text editor, code editor,
and whiteboard for the student to draw something.
